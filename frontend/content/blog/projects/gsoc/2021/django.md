## About Me

My name is Diptesh Choudhuri and I am a first year student in Bennett University situated
in Greater Noida, India. My time zone is GMT+5:30 and I live in Delhi. I have been
programming in Python for over 2 years now. I also know C, C++, Javascript, Rust and a bit
of Java. I have been involved in web development for 1.5 years now and django was the first
web framework I worked with. I have worked with various other frameworks since, and my love
for django has only increased with time.

My preferred language of communication is English and I favour written communication via
email, etc.

### Relevant work

As mentioned in the [About Me](#about-me) section, I have worked with web development for a
long time and consequently with various GraphQL based projects too.

1. **[ariadne-token-auth](https://github.com/IgnisDa/ariadne-token-auth)**: A django app to
   implement token based authentication in Ariadne GraphQL.
2. **[mdgen](https://github.com/IgnisDa/python-random-markdown-generator)**: Python library
   to generate random markdown text, especially useful for django models.
3. **[Gitzer](https://github.com/IgnisDa/Gitzer)**: A web based client for simple git
   operations.
4. **[Habitrac](https://github.com/IgnisDa/habitrac)**: A website to help you track your
   habits elegantly.
5. **[My portfolio website](https://github.com/IgnisDa/ignisda.me)**: Though not completed
   yet, this project also uses GraphQL and django. I have taken a hiatus from it to focus on GSoC for the time being.
6. **[PR to Zulip](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/17098)**: Zulip is an open source
   team chat. This PR doesn't concern django or GraphQL but since the zulip core is written in django, I decided to include this PR here.

In addition to the above, I am also highly active in the django-developers mailing list (my
name there is Diptesh Choudhuri and email is diptesh.choudhuri@gmail.com) and the r/django
reddit community.
