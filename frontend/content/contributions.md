I am an active contributor to the open source community . For a brief overview
of it, have a look at the my [Github profile](https://github.com/IgnisDa/).

Some of these contributions are large ones - like adding documentation to a
[project](https://github.com/mherrmann/selenium-python-helium/pull/42) with
over 2.2k stars. Others are quite small, such as
[fixing](https://github.com/parthpandyappp/Classroom/pull/21) a typo on a
project's README.

I will be maintaining this list to record my major contributions

1. [joke2k/faker](https://github.com/joke2k/faker/): Added my
   [package](https://pypi.org/project/mdgen/) to the documentation of this
   famous python library (it can be used to generate large amounts of fake data to
   populate databases, creating django models etc).
   [PR #1300](https://github.com/joke2k/faker/pull/1300)
2. [mherrmann/selenium-python-helium](https://github.com/mherrmann/selenium-python-helium/):
   Added documentation to this project (it provides a high level interface to
   python-selenium). I am also the documentation maintainer for
   this project. [PR #42](https://github.com/mherrmann/selenium-python-helium/pull/42)
